Currently working on several robotics projects, I've gained an interest in everything 
related to electro-mechanical energy conversion, control systems, embedded development,
and all sorts of associated tangents.  And as I learn more (and, moreover, come up with new
questions), I find that there's a world of interesting information to share!

So that's probably how this site will begin: sharing results of things I've learned while
answering questions I run across (related to robotics).
